# Big O

big O describes the upper bound of the complexity, in reality it could be less than that in some way due to other factors

## Space Complexity (auxillary space complexity - what is going on in the algorithm rather than the inputs)

boolean, number, undefined, null are constant

string and arrray are O(n)

Logs are finding what exponent value of the base will equal the given number
log 2(8) = 3
2^3 = 8
log base (value) = exponent
base ^ exponent = value

and for the calculation:

8 / 2 = 4
4 / 2 = 2
2 / 2 = 1
2 goes into 8 3 times
