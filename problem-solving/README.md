# Problem Solving

## Strategies

1. Understand the problem
   * Can I restate in my own works?
   * What are the inputs
   * what are the outputs
   * can the outputs be determined from the inputs? (is there enough info to solve the problem)
   * How should the pieces of data in the problem be labelled
2. Explore concrete examples
    * Creating user stories, unit tests etc.
    * Start with simple examples
    * Move to more complex examples
    * Check with empty and invalid inputs
3. Break it down
    * Write out the steps of the problem one by one where each step is the smallest possible
4. Solve/simplify
    * Solve the problem simply, pass over more complicated pieces at first and come back to them in step 5
    * Don't need to shoot for most optimum solution right away
5. Look back and refactor
    * Can you improve the readability?
    * The performance?

## Patterns

### Frequency Counters

Use objects or sets to collect values/frequencies of values
often can simplify nested loop solutions with arrays/strings

### Multiple Pointers

With some collection, have two "pointers" starting in different spots that move a certain direction based on some criteria until some condition is met.
