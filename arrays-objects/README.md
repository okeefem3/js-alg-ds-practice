# JS Objects and Arrays in terms of big O!

## Objects

Unordered key value pairs
great for fast access/insertion
O(1) for insertion removal and access
O(n) for searching within values

## Arrays

Ordered collections!
great for keeping order
O(1) for access
O(n) for searching
variable for insertion and removal
    inserting/removing at the end of the array is O(1)
    inserting/removing anywhere else is O(n) because of reindexing

sorting is O(n * log n)
