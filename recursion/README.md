# Recursion

A process that calls itself.

## Call Stack

Function invocation is placed on top of call stack

LIFO structure, the top is always processed first then popped off

Keep calling self until a base case is achieved, then terminate.

## Helper Method recursion

outer function with a recursive function inside

## Pure Recursion

recursion using a pure function instead of modifying state
