Built in array.sort
Default sort order is according to string unicode code points

## Bubble sort
For each item, compare it to the next item in the list, if item is larger than the next, swap them, then check that same
item against the next
repeat until no swaps done

## Selection Sort
similar to bubble, but for each item, it is compared against all others, and swapped with
the minimum item that is smaller than it until no swaps are made

sorted values are placed at the beginning of the array at the end of
each iteration (or no swap is made)

#Insertion Sort
Builds up sorted array by inserting each item where it belongs on the left side.
